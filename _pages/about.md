I will join the <a href="https://sds.cuhk.edu.cn/" target="_blank"><span style="color:black">School of Data Science</span></a> at the Chinese University of Hong Kong (Shenzhen) as an assistant professor in the summer of 2021.

My research focuses on revenue management, especially in recommendation systems. I use various methodoligies to solve real-world problems, including multi-armed bandits, online algorithms and mechanism design. Recently, I am very interested in algorithmic game theory, privacy preserving recommendations and causal inference.


I am looking for PhD students/postdocs/RA to work with me at CUHK-Shenzhen.  Students with a degree of bachelor/master/phd in math/physics/OR/... are welcome to contact me.
